these technologies. Through our National Cyber Security Strategy, the

Government of Canada will advance the ways in which we work together to

do so.

in the online world, many do not realize that they could be the target of

cyber threats. As a result, they do not have measures in place to protect","In 2016, the Government of Canada took the first step toward developing

reflects the challenges and opportunities we face.

The Cyber Review sought to take stock of the evolving threats in

cyberspace, to understand and explore the ways that cyber security

is becoming a driver of economic prosperity, and to determine the

appropriate federal role in this digital age. The Cyber Review included

in-depth engagement within the federal government cyber security

community, an evaluation of our performance under the 2010 Strategy,","Executive Summary

Collaborate and support coordination across jurisdictions and sectors to

strengthen Canada’s cyber resilience

8","The CyberPeace Institute and its academic partners should enhance

their efforts to document, track, and analyze cyberattacks against NGOs

within the Geneva ecosystem and any subsequent accountability

measures taken, including the prosecution of perpetrators.

Processes and Structures:

Swiss Public authorities should recognize the specific needs of NGOs.

In cases involving ransomware, investigations into the financial flow

stemming from extortion schemes should be conducted to hinder the

activities of threat actors. Public authorities should actively promote

the position discouraging the payment of ransom, emphasizing

that it directly finances organized crime and encourages further

cyberattacks.

Swiss Public authorities, together with the National Cyber Security","includes setting up cyber clinics to help NGOs in developing in-house

capabilities through training, or outsourcing to external providers

when necessary. Swiss public authorities and academics can play a

particular role in this regard.

Technology:

Local corporations and civil society in the Geneva ecosystem should

collaborate to share in a secure manner threat information about

attacks against NGOs and the vulnerabilities that threat actors exploit

with ease.

The CyberPeace Institute and its partners should continue to develop

free cybersecurity products for NGOs, and develop partnerships with

Geneva-based private companies to offer their solutions for free to

lessons learned, and recommendations for future cybersecurity

preparedness.

2. What happened?

In January 2020, a staff member was checking their emails and

accidentally opened a PDF file containing malware, leading to the

incident highlighted the

organization's vulnerability to cyberattacks, prompting them to

take cybersecurity more seriously. They made the decision to invest

in cybersecurity insurance shortly after this attack.

v. Harm: Distress on the employee and his colleagues.

5. Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons learned by this NGO after this incident include:

i.

Training and awareness: Regular cybersecurity training and

awareness programs for employees are essential to protect against

future attacks.

ii. Data backup and recovery: Ensuring proper data backup and

recovery procedures are in place are crucial to safeguard against

data loss during an attack.","reconstructing the website imposed considerable financial costs on

The cyberattack taught the organization several valuable lessons:

i. The importance of verifying and cross-checking payment details,

especially for invoices involving significant amounts.

ii. The need for enhanced staff awareness and training to recognize

and respond to phishing attacks.

iii. The implementation of rules and processes for handling financial

transactions securely.
